As a Technical Consultant working for Adobe India, I come across various use cases where I need a ready to use platform for testing different approaches. Think of it as a practice ground that athletes use for sharpening their skills. Now, I can go ahead with a simple web page, but the designer in me abhors badly designed web pages. Especially when you have ready to use frameworks like Bootstrap 5 and hundreds of freely available templates.

Below are some of my projects. I will keep adding as and when I create new projects

##### Toggling Passwords

<iframe height = '400' style = 'width: 100%' scrolling = 'yes' frameborder = 'no' allowtransparency = 'true' allowfullscreen = 'true' src = "/multiforms.html"></iframe> 

---

##### Character Count

<iframe height = '400' style = 'width: 100%' scrolling = 'yes' frameborder = 'no' allowtransparency = 'true' allowfullscreen = 'true' src="/charactercount.html"></iframe>
This page captures and displays the character count as a user types it.

##### Accessing Multiple APIs

<iframe height = '400' style = 'width: 100%' scrolling = 'yes' frameborder = 'no' allowtransparency = 'true' allowfullscreen = 'true' src="/multipleapis.html"></iframe>

---

##### Saving Form Data in Local Storage

<iframe height = '400' style = 'width: 100%' scrolling = 'yes' frameborder = 'no' allowtransparency = 'true' allowfullscreen = 'true' src="/sign-up.html"></iframe>
