  Most of it is relevant for all of us. Kind of serendiptious if you think when

### 13 lessons life has taught me

I’m in a reflective mood Ritesh Gupta and have been deconstructing what makes great leaders great and good humans strong. As part of my process, I’ve been considering the most valuable lessons I’ve learned from life. In the spirit of service and encouraging you to operate at your absolute best, I wanted to share 13 of them. So here you go:

**\#1.** Excellent things happen to people who do excellent things.

**\#2.** Morning exercise is a game-changer.

**\#3.** The game of leadership is helpfulness.

**\#4.** The things that are hardest to do are the things that are generally the wisest to do.

**\#5.** Creativity shines brightest when we are alone. Make time for silence, stillness and solitude.

**\#6.** Education is inoculation against disruption. Read for an hour each day to protect your hope, refine your craft and grow your knowledge.

**\#7.** The fears you don’t face become your walls. And doubts are destroyed by strong action.

**\#8.** What hurts us can help us. Leverage hardship to reclaim your natural heroism.

**\#9.** Cheap costs more.

**\#10.** Mastery takes massive practice, unrelenting patience and vast devotion. It’s a very difficult obsession. And one of the best commitments you can make.

**\#11.** An amazing family life sets you up for a glorious business life.

**\#12.** Keep your promises. Never lie. Outwork your peers. Deliver beautiful value. People watch what you do. Even if you think they don’t.

**\#13.** You can’t inspire others if you are uninspired. Actively work to keep your enthusiasm and inner fire high. Be with art. Go to conferences. Travel. Explore.
