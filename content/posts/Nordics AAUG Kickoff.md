I have started a Nordics Adobe Analytics User Group (#Nordics AAUG) in association with Adobe. Adobe Analytics User Group (AAUG) is a community of passionate Analytics users who come together to share best practices, collectively problem solve, and network. There are multiple chapters of AAUG spread across the world. Nordics AAUG is specifically for the Nordics region.

The first kick-off meeting for the Nordics AAUG was held on **June 16th** where **[Eric Matisoff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericmatisoff/)**, Principal Evangelist, Analytics and Data Science presided as the guest speaker. He spoke to an attentive audience on multiple topics such as:

- ITP prevention and how Adobe is helping companies to tackle the issue  
- Sunsetting of Google's Universal Analytics and the alternatives 
- Product updates

The participants were from a wide domain of industries such as Banking, Hospitality, Consulting and other domains. Watch the event recording that is now available on YouTube!
