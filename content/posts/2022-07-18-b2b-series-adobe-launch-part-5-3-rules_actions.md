In the previous two blog posts on the Rules topic, we covered [_Events_](/posts/b2b-series-adobe-launch-part-5.1-adobe-launch-rules-events/) and the _event types_. We also explored the different [_Conditions_](/posts/b2b-series-adobe-launch-part-5.2-adobe-launch-rules-conditions/) that are available to help us filter when Adobe Launch should or should not trigger a rule. Summing up the topic, this blog post will cover all about _Actions_ in Adobe Launch.

#### What are Actions in Adobe Launch?

If, _Events_ are the **'When'** part of a rule: helping you trigger a Rule when a user takes an action and _Conditions_ are the **'Where'** part of a rule: helping you trigger a Rule where a condition is satisified, then _Actions_ are the **'What'** part of the rule - what do you want a particular rule to do? 

Do you want it to send a beacon to Adobe Analytics? Or send data to a marketing vendor? etc. 

I figured that instead of explaining what a _Action_ in Adobe Launch can do, it is better to just demonstrate it. Do watch the video below that shows how to trigger an action of sending data to Adobe Analytics when a data layer push event is triggered.

See it is that simple to set up an _Action_. Now, you can send a custom trigger to any marketing vendor or set a cookie, whatever is your requirement, you can do it with _Actions_.

And with that we close the B2B series for **Adobe Launch**. In the next series, I will tackle all the basics about **Adobe Analytics** and **Analytics Workspace**. Meanwhile, I appreciate you taking out the time and reading through these posts. Do let me know your views on the content of the blog, and if you had like to see more. If it helps you to tackle the issues in your implementation journey, I will be highly obliged.
